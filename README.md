# Chinese Postman Problem: Discrete Mathematics Project

This project explores the Chinese Postman Problem (CPP) and its solution using graph theory and the Floyd-Warshall algorithm. The goal is to find the shortest closed walk that visits every edge of a graph at least once. The project leverages Python's NetworkX library to implement the CPP solution.

## Project Structure
- **Algorithm_Code**: Contains Python scripts implementing the Floyd-Warshall algorithm and the Eulerian circuit computation.
- **Visualizations**: Scripts and outputs for graph visualizations, including Eulerian circuits and minimum weight matching on graphs with odd-degree nodes.

## Features
- Implementation of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to solve the CPP.
- Visualization of Eulerian circuits and shortest paths.
- Application of minimum weight matching for odd-degree nodes in graphs.
